# Hiring-analysis-Dashboard
Built an interactive recruitment analytics dashboard analyzing 1,500 candidate records with evaluation scores (interview, skill, personality), experience, education, and distance. Created custom score bins, added simulated hiring prediction logic using DAX, and visualized hiring trends by score range and demographics. Included confusion matrix and top influencer insights to simulate real-world HR decision-making.
Tools used: Power BI, DAX, score binning, conditional logic, simulated prediction
Outcome: Achieved ~65% accuracy using score-based rules and visualized insights with confusion matrix and score thresholds.
